    <h1>What is JVM?</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;">A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode. The JVM is detailed by a specification that formally describes what is required in a JVM implementation. 
        Having a specification ensures interoperability of Java programs across different implementations so that program authors using the Java Development Kit (JDK) need not worry about idiosyncrasies of the underlying hardware platform. </p>
</div>

    <h1 >History of JVM</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;">The JVM was designed from the ground up to run anywhere. Its initial goal was to run on set-top boxes, but when Sun Microsystems found out the market was not ready in the mid ’90s, they decided to bring the platform to desktop computers as well. To make all those use cases possible, Sun invented their own binary executable format and called it Java bytecode. To run programs compiled to Java bytecode, a Java Virtual Machine implementation must be installed on the system. The most popular JVM implementations nowadays are Oracle’s free but partially proprietary 
        implementation and the fully open source OpenJDK project (Oracle’s Java runtime is largely based on OpenJDK).</p>
